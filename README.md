# Angular Rxjs Interop Examples

This project demonstrates the enhanced RxJS Interop capabilities in Angular 18, showcasing how Signals and RxJS Observables can be seamlessly integrated to optimize reactive state management and improve code performance and readability.

Live Demo is available at: [https://angular-rxjs-interpop-examples.web.app/](https://angular-rxjs-interpop-examples.web.app/)

The demo illustrates the key concepts described in the article: [RxJS Interop in Angular 18: Key Changes and Benefits](https://medium.com/@alex.g.petrakov/rxjs-interop-in-angular-18-key-changes-and-benefits-3e113402e525).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Firebase Configuration

To run this project, you need to update the Firebase configuration in the environment file (`src/environments/environment.ts`). Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration with your own Firebase project settings.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
